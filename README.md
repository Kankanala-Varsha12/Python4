# Python4
# Vehicle Parking Management System (Python)

# Project Overview
This project is a **Vehicle Parking Management System** implemented using Python.  
It demonstrates the use of **loops, conditional statements, user input, and control flow** through a real-world scenario of managing vehicle parking and fee collection.

# Objectives
- Demonstrate usage of 'for' and 'while' loops
- Implement 'break' and 'continue' statements
- Work with user input in real-world scenarios
- Iterate over string characters
- Generate multiplication tables
- Use 'range()' with step values
- Combine loops with conditions
- Simulate a realistic parking management system

# Technologies Used
- Python 3

# File Structure

# Features Implemented
- Display parking slot numbers (1–100)
- Countdown timer for gate opening
- Vehicle entry with fee calculation
- Emergency vehicle detection
- String iteration for number plate validation
- Hourly parking fee table
- Maintenance slot checks using step range
- Payment confirmation with retry logic

# Parking Fee Structure
| Vehicle Type | Fee (₹) |
|-------------|---------|
| Bike | 20 |
| Car | 50 |
| Truck | 100 |

# How to Run the Program
1. Open terminal / command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the program using:
   '''bash
